This is a script to generate a filtered sound pulse and send it to a sound 
board.

The first cell will set the experiment parameters and create an ALSA pcm 
object for sound playback. The following cell send the stimulus to the sound 
board.

This code is profoundly inspired in a Matlab code, written by Dr. Richardson 
Le√£o, PhD.
